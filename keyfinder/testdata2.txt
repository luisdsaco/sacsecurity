Although it is possible to win a Champions by fortune, we must analyze it in deeper. We could consider that the probability of doing it could be 0,1 (that seems a excessively high value). In that case, the probability of winning 14 would be the probability of the union of 14 independent events, that would be 0,00000000000001. Namely, winning a Champions by luck is very improbable, but winning 14 can be considered statistically impossible. Then, it is impossible that Real Madrid can be a Champions League winner by luck. It you do not even have a minimal knowledge in mathematics, best you should not try to work as a sport journalist.

Set of tools to increase cyber-security

In this repository you can find several tools to increase the security of linux systems.

The first one is a tool providing a vpn kill switch based on Network Manager.

An vpn kill switch is a tool that prevent you to continue sending packages over the network when the vpn fails.
There are several strategies to get this aim. This is the easier one but, probably, the less secure too.

It has been tested in Ubuntu, Arch linux (with Network Manager installed) and Kali linux.

The next program is a future testing tool written in x86-64 assembler that will find fastly passwords in strings and files. It is currently in development. You can see the source code at the directory keyfinder.
